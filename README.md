# ppp

`ppp` is a library for
[permutations](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PermutationGroup.html) in
PureScript. Currently, it is something of a work-in-progress, but it already has
functions to multiply and invert permutations.

## Installation

To add to your project:

```bash
psc-package install permutations
```

## Building

Using [pulp](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/pulp):

```bash
 $ pulp build
 $ pulp test
```
